# User Churn Rate: Waze App Analysis

## Introduction
Waze is a mobile navigation app that provides real-time navigation satellite to give the drives the most efficient route to their desired destination. The dataset utilized in this project was taken from the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate course on Coursera,** which I had successfully completed in September 2024.


This project showcases my data analytics skills and how I would approach a problem presented to me. I walk through my initial EDA findings in Part 1, all the way to the results of my supervised classification model in Part 5.
